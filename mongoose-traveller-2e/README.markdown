### Additions

From the *Traveller Companion*:

- Experience points
- Affinity, enmity, power, influence, and special characteristics for allies, contacts, rivals, and enemies
- Characteristic DMs for high attributes

From the *Aliens of Charted Space*:

### Changes

- All the tabs have been rearranged
- The history section has been expanded
- There's a single list for skills

### Omissions

- Psionics, as I don't use them in my games.
- Study Periods, as I use the experience points system instead.
- NPC and Ship sheets, this is just a PC sheet.
